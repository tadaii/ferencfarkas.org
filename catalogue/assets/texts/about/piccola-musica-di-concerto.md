> My piece entitled Piccola musica di concerto aims to revive the practice of
> playing music at home as it was customary in Haydn's time.
>
> It is a relatively easy work of lucid structure and simple shaping which,
> though it tries to avoid special difficulties, gives the performer a
> demanding task by the irregular rhythms of the last movement.
>
> The four-movement work was written in 1961 and has often been performed in
> most of the concert halls of the world

> The first movement is a cheerful Allegro in sonata form. It is followed by
> a short slow Andante and a graceful Scherzo with a pizzicato trio.
> The final movement is a fast rondo written in the so-called "Bulgarian rhythm".
