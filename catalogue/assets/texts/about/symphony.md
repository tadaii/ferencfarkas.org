Ferenc Farkas composed his Symphony in 1952.

> “It was the first time that I tackled this musical genre.
> In my Symphony, of neoclassical character but without any style constraints,
> I have put on an explosion of strong emotions.
>
> Attendance at concerts having democratized with the arrival of communism,
> it was necessary to adapt my work that lasts three quarters of an hour to
> an audience not only made up of traditional listeners but also less
> knowledgeable workers.

> At the Union of Musicians the new works were regularly discussed and my
> Symphony also came up for examination. With the exception of my friend
> the composer Lajos Vass, every one of the participants made such
> disheartening comments that I lost all enthusiasm and I put my Symphony
> away in a drawer”.
