> The « March Suite » was composed in December 1947 to celebrate the memory of the Hungarian revolution and the struggle for 
> independence of the years 1848-49 against Austrian domination.  
>
> In the 1940s Farkas was one of the first in Hungary to experiment with dodecaphonic music. But under the Soviet pressure after 
> the Second World War, everything that the great masters of the early 20th century had created was labeled by the new communist 
> regime as “modernist formalism” and condemned. Musicians were obliged to adopt a new style of music which was « easy to 
> understand and in a mood of constant optimism ». Under penalty of being sanctioned Farkas also returned to this path. 
>
> The cheerfulness of the work is apparent from the first hearing. According to the composer’s analysis, the first movement, in 
> a small sonata form, is characterised by the sound of enthusiasm, the second movement, in ternary form, is a lament for fallen 
> heroes, the third movement (rondo) depicts a bustling battle scene, with horn and trumpet calls.
