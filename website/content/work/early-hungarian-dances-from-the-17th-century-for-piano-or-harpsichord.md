> In Hungarian music, folk songs are obviously of great importance,
> but our ancient airs and dances play a more  modest role.
>
> For this work, I was influenced by 17th century dances, written by
> unknown amateurs in a relatively simple style.
>
> Most of these dances were written between the 14th and 18th centuries
> in the usual form of tablature notation.
>
> My interest in this music was first captured in the 1940s.
> I was so fascinated that I decided to give these melodies new life.
> I assembled small eight bar dances into trios, I put together in the
> form of rondos and, using the harmony and counterpoint of the Old Baroque,
> I tried to recreate the atmosphere of a “provincial” Hungarian baroque style.
