## About the work

My « Vidróczki », composed in 1963, is what I would describe as a popular romantic opera: after Ede Poldoni's « The Carnival Wedding » and Dohnányi's « The Tenor » in the early twenties, there had been a gap in the history of this once popular genre which I wanted to fill. I wrote my work for the Szeged Open Air Festival, which attracts close to eight thousand spectators each year. It is a different audience to one for a chamber concert of Beethoven's C sharp minor  « String quartet ». To please the average concert-goer, it is necessary to provide a piece with a spectacle and easier listening. The opera relates the adventures and death of Vidróczki, a big-hearted bandit who lived in the nineteenth century in the Mátra Hills. I had particular pleasure setting to music a scene in which a marriage and a burial proceed simultaneously.
