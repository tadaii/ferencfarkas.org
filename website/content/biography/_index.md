Ferenc Farkas studied composition in Budapest with
[Albert Siklós](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Sikl%C3%B3s) and
[Leo Weiner](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Leó_Weiner).
After working some time as a "repetiteur", he went to Rome to study with
[Ottorino Respighi](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottorino_Respighi) (1929 - 1931).

That was the time when he discovered his true artistic identity. Respighi
introduced him to different forms and styles of Italian music.

He also
transmitted to him his virtuosity in the art of instrumentation, his taste
for orchestral colors, his passion of ancient music and his vision for
the modern art.

In Rome, Farkas became familiar with latin and mediterranean cultures,
including painting and poetry in which he showed interest since he was child.

After two years of studies, he went back to Budapest.

> When I returned from Rome, I thought the world is mine but soon I understood
that I will not succeed to find a stable job.

As the [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression) was
being felt heavily in Hungary, Farkas only found odd jobs like theatre
co-repetiteur, choirmaster and music teacher.

In 1933, his meeting with the world-renowned hungarian film director
[Pal Fejős](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Fejos) gave him his first
experiences in the completely new field of cinematography. During their
collaboration, Farkas composed the music of 6 movies and 25 short films
on Madagascar.

He took advantage of this situation to travel and discover
Europe and its cultures: for shooting interests he spent 2 years in Vienna,
2 years in Copenhagen and cruised around the Mediterranean during the winter
of 1933-34.

Farkas continued to compose film music for other directors until 1973
(73 film music).

Ferenc Farkas returned in Hungary for good in 1936. His first real public
success happened in 1937 with his [Concertino for harp](/work/?q=id:concertino-for-harp-and-string-orchestra-or-string-quartet).

{{< play concertino-for-harp-and-orchestra "3rd movement: Allegro moderato" "Concertino for harp and orchestra, 1937" >}}

It was also the time when he started his long collaboration with theater
and radio. He composed incidental music for some 40 plays by hungarian and
foreign authors like Madách, Vörösmarty, Shakespeare, Calderón, Moliere,
Rostand, Aristophanes, Goethe, Lope de Vega…

This was for Farkas an unlimited
field of experimentations. He will often use this music to compose other works.

The Second World War broke out in 1939.
